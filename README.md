# Code for "How the Other Mode Lives: Age of Family Formation in the CPS Fertility Supplement"

## Motivation: 
This blog is part of a [larger writing project](https://github.com/wyattclarke/half-baked-ideas-blog/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-22-commune-dreaming.md) to design cooperative living communities that catalyze healthy growth in early adulthood by setting up high-functioning multi-family households that are helped by mentors. The purpose is to provide empirical underpinnings for what I'm writing. 

Larger households allow more efficient consumption of market goods and more efficient home production. That is, larger households can buy in bulk and share chores.

The two most central tasks I want to enable are healthy child rearing and gaining professional credentials. The realities of these tasks differ starkly between the lives of “front-row” and “back-row” Americans, to borrow a phrase from Chris Arnade. In back-row America, you typically become a parent in your early 20s. Professional certification takes a few tries – with very low initial college completion rates – and happens with kids in the picture.

Ancillary goals include reducing incidence of CPS child removal, empowering more adults to provide foster care, assisting youths recently aged out of foster care, creating an outlet for Christians and others to engage in service, and giving senior citizens a community where they can contribute and belong.

## Major results: 
1. CPS fertility data show a bi-modal pattern of when women become mothers, with peaks in the early and late 20s. This is similar to the pattern found in health datasets.
2. Thirty-five percent of young children's mom are less than 30 years old, and 21% of their dads are under 30 years old.
3. The average family income experienced by young children (0–5 years) of young mothers (19–22 years at birth) is about half that of children whose become mothers after 30. 
4. Teenage children of mothers who had kids young are much more likely not to live with their biological mother than in families where kids came later. 
5. I found no evidence that young children of young moms are more often missing from the home, but there is reason for skepticism that CPS' sample frame would be able to detect this type of pattern if it exists.
